It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **If you want to skill up, check out [my guide to getting started](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started), and if you want to jump into an open problem check out my sequence [200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems).**\n",

There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).

The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

These results totally don't do the paper justice - go check it out if you want to see the full results!)"
